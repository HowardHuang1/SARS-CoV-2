Mutation can occur if during replication, a mistake is made in copying the RNA or DNA of a viral particle. Some types of viruses can also swap genetic material with nearby viral particles, a process called recombination.  Sometimes a mutation \"breaks\" a virus, and makes it unable to reproduce in which case the lineage of virus with that mutation will die off. Sometimes a mutation \"improves\" a virus, and makes it better and spreading or reproducing, in which case the mutation will probably stick around.
